This Assignment was written in a Jupyter Notebook located in this repository. Please download this Jupyter Notebook to see the assignment details in full. Github rendering of the Jupyter Notebook results in various errors including:
* Some images not being displayed correctly.
* HTML not being displayed.
* Links within the document not functioning.
* Complex LaTex not rendering properly.

All the above works perfectly in native Jupyter Notebook.

To run the notebook, open it and go to Kernel -> Clear and Run All. This will not go to completion - see warning below.
